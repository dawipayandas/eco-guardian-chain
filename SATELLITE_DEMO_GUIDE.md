## üöÄ Live Demo Script

### 1. **Landing Page Introduction** (30 seconds)
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8081`
- **What to show**: "This is a blockchain-based carbon credit marketplace with satellite verification"
- **Key point**: "Unlike traditional verification that relies only on manual reports, we use real satellite data"

### 2. **Navigate to Community Verification** (1 minute)
- **Click**: "Community Verifier" button on landing page
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8081/community-verification`
- **What to highlight**: 
  - "This is where community verifiers can validate restoration projects"
  - "Notice we have three tabs: Pending Reviews, Peer Review, and **Satellite Analysis**"

### 3. **Satellite Analysis Tab Demo** (3-4 minutes)
- **Click**: "Satellite Analysis" tab
- **What to demonstrate**:

#### A. Real-time Satellite Imagery Comparison
```
"Here's our satellite analysis for the Pichavaram Mangrove Restoration project in Tamil Nadu, India"
- Before image: January 15, 2024
- After image: September 28, 2024
- 75-hectare restoration area
```

#### B. AI-Powered Vegetation Analysis
- **Point out the metrics**:
  - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): Shows vegetation health
  - EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index): Accounts for soil background
  - SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index): Reduces soil interference
  - Coverage percentage increase

#### C. Interactive Time Series Monitoring
- **Highlight the charts**:
  - "This shows vegetation growth over 8 months"
  - "You can see the seasonal patterns and growth trends"
  - "AI confidence levels for each measurement"

#### D. Carbon Sequestration Calculations
```
"The system automatically calculates:
- Carbon captured per hectare
- Total CO2 equivalent reduction
- Estimated monetary value in carbon credits"
```

### 4. **Technical Implementation Highlights** (2 minutes)

#### A. Google Earth Engine Integration
```
"Behind the scenes, we're using:
- Google Earth Engine APIs for satellite data
- Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery
- Multi-spectral analysis algorithms
- Machine learning for change detection"
```

#### B. Real-world Coordinates
```
"These are actual coordinates: 
- Latitude: 11.4270¬∞N
- Longitude: 79.7729¬∞E
- This is the real Pichavaram Mangrove Forest in India"
```

### 5. **Blockchain Integration** (1 minute)
- **Navigate to**: Investor Marketplace (`/investor-marketplace`)
- **Show**: "Satellite-verified projects get higher credibility scores"
- **Point out**: "Carbon credits backed by satellite proof, not just paperwork"

## üéØ Key Selling Points to Emphasize

### 1. **Transparency & Trust**
- "No more 'trust us' - here's satellite proof from space"
- "Impossible to fake satellite imagery from multiple dates"

### 2. **Automated Verification**
- "Reduces human bias and corruption in verification"
- "AI analyzes vegetation indices that humans can't see"

### 3. **Real-time Monitoring**
- "Track project progress continuously, not just annual reports"
- "Early detection of project failures or success"

### 4. **Scientific Accuracy**
- "Uses the same technology NASA uses for climate research"
- "Multiple vegetation indices cross-validate each other"

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features Showcased
